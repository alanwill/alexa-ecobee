## Alexa Skill for controlling Ecobee Thermostats

Alexa currently supports ecobee natively using the Smart Home API however the supported _Intents_ are still pretty [limited](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/smart-home-skill-api-reference#Temperature Control Messages). I decided to build this skill to fill in the gaps. 

### Intents Supported

* GetTemperature

### To Do

Add support for the following intents:
* SetAway
* SetHome
